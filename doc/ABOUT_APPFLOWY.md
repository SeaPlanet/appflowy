# About

AppFlowy is an open-source alternative to Notion and Airtable, a no-code platform for anyone to build apps that suit their needs well.

Design and modify AppFlowy your way, with a single codebase written in Flutter and Rust supporting multiple platforms armed with long-term maintainability.

And you have **100%** control of your data.

Most workplace SaaS tools are limited in terms of customizations and data control. We don't believe that one workplace SaaS solution can fit all companies or individuals not to mention that a glass ceiling on what's possible in the future. Our mission is to make it possible for anyone to create apps that suit their needs well. Therefore, we are dedicated to creating AppFlowy, a powerful no-code open-source solution. This would not only democratize the knowledge of making complex workplace SaaS tools but also enable people and businesses to make beautiful things on their own.
